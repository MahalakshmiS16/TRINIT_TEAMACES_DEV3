    <h1>Blight</h1>
    <p>Blight is a sudden and severe plant disease that results in yellowing, wilting, and falling of leaves. It can be caused by various pathogens such as fungi, bacteria, or viruses. Bacterial blight is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris and is common in crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and beans.
    Fungal blights are caused by various fungi and can affect a wide range of plants. Virus blights are caused by different plant viruses and result in yellowing and stunted growth of infected plants. The treatment of blight depends on the type of pathogen causing the disease. For bacterial blights, removal and destruction of infected plants, crop rotation, and copper-based fungicides can be used. For fungal blights, removal and destruction of infected plant debris, crop rotation, and fungicides such as chlorothalonil or mancozeb can be used.</p>

<br><b>SYMPTOMS</b></br>
 <p>The symptoms of blight can vary depending on the type of pathogen causing the disease. However, some common symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and falling of leaves. Bacterial blight causes brown or black leaf spots and wilting of leaves. Fungal blights can result in leaf spots, wilting, and premature death of infected plants. Virus blights cause yellowing and stunted growth of infected plants. In some cases, infected plants may develop lesions or discoloration on stems and leaves, or the fruit may become discolored or misshapen. In advanced stages of infection, the plant may wilt and die. It's important to identify and treat blight as soon as possible to prevent it from spreading to other plants in the garden. Regular monitoring of plants and early detection of symptoms can help prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
   
<p><b>TREATMENT</b></p>
Unfortunately, there is no cure for virus blights and infected plants must be removed and destroyed to prevent the spread of the virus. Good hygiene and sanitation in the garden, such as removing and destroying infected plant debris, avoiding overhead watering, and avoiding working with wet plants, can help prevent the spread of blights and other plant diseases.
